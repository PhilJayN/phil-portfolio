          <p>
            Yorkie World is a site I created for a client who absolutely adores
            their Yorskire Terrier. The following are their requests:
          </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The site should work on phones, laptops, and desktop computers</li>
            <li>There should be a "cool fun game" on the main page</li>
            <li>There should be a gallery to showcase selected pictures</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I'll be discussing a general step-by-step of the planning, developing, and finalizing.
        </p>

        <h3>Planning</h3>
          <p>Since this was a deadline oriented project, I wanted to make sure to spend
          a little bit of extra time during this phase gather data to create a general
          outline of the whole project. Due to project's dependency on JavaScript,
          I knew ahead of time that bugs in the program would
          be inevitable. Instead of being afraid of it, I wanted to embrace it. It was
          important to allocate additional time for bug fixing and testing.</p>

          <h5>Colors and Layout</h5>
          <p>
            To get an idea of the color schemes for the site, I looked at the pictures
            the client gave me. The colors have to have some sort of purpose.
            The Yorkies are beautiful, so I wanted to accentuate those pictures and not
            overpower them with colors. Because of this, I decided I needed a simple,
            monochromatic color scheme. In addition, an idea struck at
            me when I was re-reading the client requests. Since they wanted a "cool
            and fun" game, I literally took that advice and decided to go with
            a color which is by nature cool instead of warm. Also, blue is typically
            considered a universally beautiful color, and humans tend to have a
            positive affinity for blue.
          </p>

        <h3>Developing</h3>
        <h5>Code Organization</h5>
        <p>My past experiences with JavaScript taught me that I needed a way to organize
        my code, to make it easier to maintain, read, and debug.
        There are quite a few ways to organize code, as discussed in jQuery's
        <a href="https://learn.jquery.com/code-organization/concepts/">Code Organization Concepts.</a>
        I wanted to keep it simple and organize my code in an object literal, using some of the
        following methods for the game: shuffle(), assignCards(), resetGame(), and handlers().
        All went well until I hit the weirdest problem while testing. </p>
        <h5>Picture Matching Game Debugging</h5>
        <p>Everytime I called the resetgame() method, console.log showed the shuffled array.
        However, the picture in the matching game was not being assigned the proper picture from the array.
        </p>

        <p>I went through a list of potential areas in the code that could cause the problem and
        narrowed it down to the .assignCards() method.
        The .assignCards() method used jQuery's <code>.attr()</code> method to change the picture source
        of the cards.
        But they were not matching! Upon careful inspection, I noticed that
        <code>.attr()</code> and <code>.data()</code> was being used in the same line of code.
        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9768165/jquery-data-selector-not-updating-with-data">
          Stack Overflow helped
          guide me</a>
         in the right direction. jQuery's <code>.data()</code> does not change the attribute
        in the DOM. This is why the pictures in the memory game was not being updated with
        the new values from the shuffled array. All I had to do was change <code>.data()</code> to <code>.attr()</code>.
      </p>

    <p>
        I made the most progress during debugging process when I changed my mindset.
        The solution presented itself when I went from a "I just don't get this" to "I'm going
        to figure this out no matter what."
    </p>

        <h5>Responsive Design with Media Queries</h5>
        <p>
          I decided to go with a <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/web/mobile-first-responsive-web-design/">
          Mobile First</a> design for this project. The limited content of a small
          phone screen forced me to really focus on the essential content of the project.
           After testing that the site
          worked on mobile phones, I moved on to develop for tablets and desktop using media queries.
          Chrome developer tool device emulator was extremly helpful during the drafting of the site. Of course, the final
          test was done using real phones.
        </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>This was a very rewarding project. The debugging process was one of the
            most challenging. But my past experiences taught me to have a methodical approach
            to finding bugs: Narrow it down to the parts that might cause problem. This is why it's important
            to write modular code, to help during these situations. I'm on a quest to become better at debugging
            and writing clean code.</p>
            As a side note,
            one of the biggest motivating factor was having a deadline. I've learned
          to embrace deadlines. It drives me forward and keeps me focused. There's
          no better feeling than having those constant reminders that I needed to
          finish.</p>
