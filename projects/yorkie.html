          <p>
            Yorkie World is a site I created for a client who absolutely adores
            their Yorskire Terrier. The following are their requests:
          </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The site should work on mobile devices, laptops, and desktop computers.</li>
            <li>There should be a "cool fun game" on the main page.</li>
            <li>There should be a gallery to showcase selected pictures.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I'll be discussing a general step-by-step from the beginning to the end
          of the project, starting with the planning, developing, and finalizing.
        </p>

        <h3>Planning</h3>
          <p>Since this was a deadline oriented project, I wanted to make sure to spend
          a little bit of extra time during this process to make sure I have a general
          outline of the whole project. Due to the nature of the project and how it
          would utilize JavaScript, I knew ahead of time that bugs in the program would
          be inevitable. Instead of being afraid of it, I wanted to embrace it. Therefore,
          It was important add in additional time for bug-fixing and testing.</p>

          <h5>Colors and Layout</h5>
          <p>
            Looking at the pictures
            the client gave me, I decided I needed a simple color scheme. I needed
            a monochromatic scheme. There
            are about a bazillion different color to chose. An idea struck at
            me when I was re-reading the client requests. Since they wanted a "cool
            and fun" game, I literally took that advice and decided to go with
            a color is is by nature cool instead of warm. Also, blue is typically
            considered a universally beautiful color, and humans tend to have a
            positive affinity for blue.
          </p>

        <h3>Developing</h3>
        <h5>Picture Matching Game Debugging</h5>
        I assigned my code in an object literal, using some of the
        following methods: shuffle(), assignCards(), resetGame(), and handlers().
        All went well until I hit the weirdest problem while testing: Everytime I
        called the resetgame() method, console.log showed the shuffled array.
        However, the picture in the matching game was not being assigned the proper picture.

        <p>
          I made the most progress during debugging process when I changed my mindset.
          The solution presented itself when I went from a "I just don't get this" to "I'm going
          to figure this out no matter what."
        </p>
        I went through a list of potential areas in the code that could cause the problem, and
        narrowed it down to the .assignCards() method. Looking through the source code,
        the .assignCards() method used jQuery's <code>.attr()</code> methods to change the picture source
        of the cards.
        But they were not matching! Upon careful inspection, I noted that both the src
        and data attribute was being used in the same line of code.
        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9768165/jquery-data-selector-not-updating-with-data">
          Stack Overflow helped
          guide me</a>
         in the right direction. jQuery <code>.data()</code> does not change the attribute
        in the DOM. This is why the pictures in the memory game was not being updated with
        the new values from the shuffled array.


        <h5>Responsive Design with Media Queries</h5>
        <p>
          I decided to go with a <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/web/mobile-first-responsive-web-design/">
          Mobile First</a> design for this project. I really like doing it like this. The limited content of a small
          phone screen forces me to really focus on the essential content. After testing that the site
          worked on mobile phones, I moved on to develop for tablets and desktop using media queries.
          Chrome developer tool device emulator was extremly helpful during the drafting of the site. Of course, the final
          test was done using real phones.
        </p>

        <h3>Finalizing</h3>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>One of the biggest motivating factor was having a deadline. I've learned
          to embrace deadlines. It drives me forward and keeps me focused. There's
          no better feeling than having those constant reminders that I needed to
          finish.</p>
