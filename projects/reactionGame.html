        <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
        <ul>

        </ul>

<p>
  At the core of the game's code is a .render() method whose primary job is, just like it's name suggests,
  is to render the target for the user to hit.
</p>

Here is a tiny, condensed code snippet:

<code>


    render: function () {
      var $bullseye = $('.bullseye');
      var $rxnGameWrapper = $('.rxn-game-wrapper');

      var posX = (Math.random() * (wMax - wBox)).toFixed();
      var posY = (Math.random() * (hMax - hBox)).toFixed();

      $bullseye.css({
        'position': 'absolute',
        'left': posX +'px',
        'top': posY + 'px',
      });
    },

</code>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          The goal is to use jQuery and CSS to assign a random position for the target.
          If we were to do this manually, we would do something like this: </p>

<code>
  $bullseye.css({
    'position': 'absolute',
    'left': '23px',
    'top':  '130px',
  });
</code>

But we have computers to do the work for us:

<code>
  $bullseye.css({
    'position': 'absolute',
    'left': posX +'px',
    'top': posY + 'px',
  });
</code>

<p>
  The variable posX and posY will have a new random number everytime the render method is
  used. This will allow us to have different positions.
</p>

<p>
          During the development process, one of the challenge is keeping the target
          inside its container. Because the target's position is set to absolute in CSS,
          it does not stay within the confiment of its parent div. The goal is to
          generate a "random" position to assign to the CSS 'left' and 'top' property. To solve this problem,
          the following steps were used:

        </p>

<ul>
  <li>Find the size of the game container(ex: 200px) and subtract the target size(ex: 50px) from it, resulting in 150px</li>
  <li>Generate a "random" number and multiply it by 150px from above step</li>
  <li></li>

</ul>

<p>
  That's it! Now everytime the .render() method is called, the 'left' and 'top' position
  of the target gets assigned a new number. Then the target will be rendered in its new position!
</p>
