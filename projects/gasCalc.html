<h3>Beware of the spaghetti monster from Planet YumYum!</h3>
<p>
  Prepare your eyes. You are about to be exposed to dangerously high amounts of wet spaghetti that can be found in the source code.
</p>

<p>
  The creation of this project was a rather unique because I did not have access to tutorials. Other projects are more straighforward because there are books or video tutorials
  that explain how to create the app. I have not seen anyone make a calculator like this before so I had to do this from scratch. Sure there are discount calculators, but that's fairly straighforward.
  This app I had to take into consideration each individual element, since every element rely on each other to update the final result.

			<h4>Lessons Learned
			</h4>
			<ul>
<li>Take time to give variables proper descriptive names in the first place.
This way I won't confuse myself weeks later.
</li>
<li>Learn modular code before tackling a long project. It will make refactoring code easier.</li>
				<li>Draw flow control on a piece of paper so I can refer back to it when debugging. Don't try to keep flow control all in my head.</li>
				<li>Don't get caught up with regular expression. Sometimes they can help, other times make the situations worse.</li>
			</ul>
