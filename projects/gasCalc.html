      <h3>Beware of the spaghetti monster from Planet YumYum!</h3>

        <p>
          Prepare your eyes. You are about to be exposed to dangerously high amounts of wet spaghetti that can be found in the source code.
        </p>


        <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Take time to give variables proper descriptive names in the first place.
            This way I won't confuse myself weeks later.
          </li>
          <li>Learn modular code before tackling a long project. It will make refactoring code easier.</li>
          <li>Draw flow control on a piece of paper so I can refer back to it when debugging. Don't try to keep flow control all in my head.</li>
          <li>Don't get caught up with regular expression. Sometimes they can help, other times make the situations worse.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Final Note</h3>
        <p>
          The creation of this project was a rather unique because I did not have access to tutorials. Other projects are more straighforward because there are books or video tutorials
          that explain how to create the app.
          This app was a challenge to implement because there are many elements that affected each other. When I changed one part of the code, some of the other parts started changing.
          This is what propels to to learn modular JavaScript. I'm still in a very early part of learning to program, so modular JavaScript will come naturally one day.
