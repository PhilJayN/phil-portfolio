<h3>Lessons Learned
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use less jQuery selectors. DOM is my friend.</li>
  <li>Comment abstract parts of code. It will be easier to read weeks later.</li>
  <li>console.log is a guardian angel. Use it often for debugging!</li>
</ul>


<p>
  Final : While learning programming, project creation should be priority. There is very little point in learning knowledge
  but never applying it. My mistake was not starting projects sooner.
  For anyone out there learning programming, I highly recommend getting started on a project.
  Now. It doesn't have to be anything fancy. Just start.


  My learning routine is fairly straightforward now: Find programming books with good reviews,
  learn the main concepts, and get cranking on a project. Rinse and repeat.
