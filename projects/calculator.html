        <h3>Lessons Learned
</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Use less jQuery selectors. DOM is my friend.</li>
            <li>Comment abstract parts of code. It will be easier to read weeks later.</li>
            <li>console.log is a guardian angel. Use it often for debugging!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Final Note
</h3>
        <p>
            My mistake during the early learning process was not starting projects sooner. My learning routine is more straightforward now:

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Find programming books with good reviews.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Learn the main concepts, and write down some questions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scratch head and lose some hair.</li>
                <li>
                    Start on a project. Write down more questions.
                </li>
                <li>Search on Stack Overflow or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/">Reddit</a> if still stuck.
                </li>
                <li>Attend Meetup.com groups and ask others for help.</li>
                <li>Profit and celebrate!</li>
            </ol>
