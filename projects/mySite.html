        <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Plan and draw the structure of the site on a piece of paper before coding the HTML. This makes it easier to imagine the finished design. </li>
            <li>Decide on a color scheme before doing CSS so that there's consistency in page design.</li>
            <li>CSS page should be neatly organized into sections for easier search at a glance.</li>
            <li>Jekyll is really useful for creating templates!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Final Note</h3>
        <p>
            I wish I planned this project a little better to help with organizing. Towards the middle of the project, I became stuck with analysis paralysis. I spent too much time deciding on page structure and layout. This should have been done from the start. The
            next course of action is to learn more about software design process to help me plan projects more efficiently. Why should I care about this? Well, I want to utilize my time better.
