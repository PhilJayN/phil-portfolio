        <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Plan and draw the structure of the site on a piece of paper before coding the HTML. This makes it easier to plan the finished design. </li>
            <li>Decide on a color scheme before doing CSS so that there's consistency in page design.</li>
            <li>CSS page should be neatly organized into sections for easier search at a glance.</li>
            <li>Jekyll is really useful for creating templates!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Final Note</h3>
        <p>
            I wish I planned this project a little better in the beginning.
            Towards the middle of the project, I became stuck with analysis paralysis. I spent too much time deciding on page structure and layout. This should have been done from the start. The
            next course of action is to learn more about layout and structure to help me plan projects more efficiently.
