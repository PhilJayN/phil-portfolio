I do not have a formal design background, so I need to learn the fundamentals. I've signed up for Lynda.com
design courses. And just for fun, I'm also reading The Design of Everyday Things by AUTHOR, as suggested in a Reddit AMA with Mike
Bostock, the incredibly talented creator of Data Driven Docs, who is also my inspiration for writing better JavaScript code.
Just look at how he writes his code. Amazingly beautiful! LINK.

<h3>Global Variables and Its Complications</h3>
I wish I knew about some of the bad practices with writing JavaScript before actually creating my projects. Currently, my <a href="../projects/gasCalc.html">gas calculator</a> has many global variables. I'm in the process of rewriting some of the code to fix this issue.
As stated in Douglas Crockford's book, JavaScript The Good Parts, global variables can be convienient in small programs, but they can become very unweildy in larger programs. Global variables can be changed by
other parts of the program, so this can pose a problem. You probably have the same question as I do: "If global variables are so bad, what are the alternatives then?"

<p>
  Currently, I do not have the answer, but I'm researching more, so stay tuned.
</p>
<p>
  I realize that my source code isn't the most beautiful thing in the world,
  so I want to improve it. I am now researching more on JavaScript style guidelines. Among the best I've found is the following:
</p>


<ul>
  <li><a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml">Google's</a>style guidelines</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js">idiomatic.js</a>Principles of Writing Consistent JavaScript </li>
</ul>

<h3>Git Commit Messages and Modular Code</h3>
<p>
  Today I'm doing a very small "To Do" application to allow me to focus on two things: creating better commit messages by following <a href="http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/">guidelines</a>. Eventually
  I'll get to reading the book Pro Git, but for right now I just want to follow some basics.
</p>


<p>
  Second on the agenda is to practice modular approach to JavaScript by specifically using the <a href="https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript">revealing module pattern. </a>
While writing some of my older applications, one of my challenges is coming up face-to-face with messy codes. You can see that for yourself here.
It is my hope that learning a way to encapsulate code into logically blocks will not only make my code easier for others to look at, but also make it less confusing when debugging.

<h3>Refactoring Code to Improve Code</h3>
Feb 1, 2017
As programs get longer and longer, it gbecomes increasingly more crucial to refactor. Refactoring doesn't actually change the feature of the code, but it does
provide tremendous benefits, including but not limited to making the code easier for you and other developers to read, and makes it more organized.
