			<h1>Welcome!</h1>
			<p>I created this site as a way to share programming related knowledge. I am so grateful for all the help that has been given to me.</p>

			<!-- Information overload can be overwhelming, so I wanted a place to centralize the pieces of information that I have gathered. -->
			<!-- <p>Here you will find projects that I have worked on, blog posts about me banging my head against the wall due to programming issues, and general posts about computer issues and their solutions.</p> -->

			<!-- Don't worry. I'll do my best to organize the information in separate areas. Programming related things will be in one area. My favorite puppy breeds will in another area. You won't find them together, unless I'm using puppy images to demonstrate programming.

	This way you can what you're looking for. -->
			<p>If there is anything that I can do for <em>you</em>, let me know! I don't have every answer, but I'll find a way to get those answers. Better yet, why don't <em>we</em> figure it out together?</p>
