<h2 id="aboutme"> About me</h2>
		I like frozen grapes <del>and honey</del>. It's like a summer explosion in my mouth. Try it? <br />
		My favorite Reddit sub is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StartledCats/">StartledCats!</a> <!--add JS here to tell user clicking link will open in a new window. Use <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StartledCats/" target="_blank">StartledCats!</a> -->
		My morning routine consists of brewing a cup of green tea and watching cute cats. Puppies make me happy too.
